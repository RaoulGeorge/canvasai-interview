# Take home assignment

- [x] Create `Project` component based on the `Project card.png` sketch.

  Feel free to use any css styling approach for this assignment (styled-components, css modules, `className` props etc.)

- [x] Use data from `data.js` file to generate a list of `Project` components

- [x] Use `Search` input component to filter projects list by name

  This task requires to write a JS function to filter projects if matched with a search query, or some *Nothing found* placeholder if thereâ€™s no match

- [x] Without using any form input libraries implement a tags input component
  The input component that takes text as input and by hitting Enter transforms the input into a tag that is displayed inside the input field. Each tag has a button to remove it.
  Here is the example of Bootstrap plugin: [Bootstrap Tags Input](https://bootstrap-tagsinput.github.io/bootstrap-tagsinput/examples/)

- [x] When you are done with the assignment answer the following questions in this README:
  - How much time did you spend on the assignment? ~6 hours
  - What was the most difficult task? - Using styled components - I haven't used it for a few years.
  
  Feel free to share any other notes on this assignment
  Due to time constraints I did not add a few features that I would have liked -:
   - icon on the tag which removes it. Instead I made the entire tag clickable.
   - I would have included proptypes or some type system.
   - More test coverage.
   - I did not put a whole lot of thought in the aethetics of the project card.


## After completion
Upload the repo to any source-code-hosting (GitHub, GitLab, etc.) and provide a link to it
